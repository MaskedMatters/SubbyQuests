# SubbyQuests
 A game where you go around doing quests in a submarine around the world!

Currently, we are trying to recreate a game called _submersible_ by _awesome-llama_ on Scratch. You can find his original game here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/811805586

Our long-term plan is to turn this game into a place where you can roam around doing quests in different seas, fighting bad guys, upgrading your ship, and much much more. Stay tuned on this GitHub repository for more updates and releases.

## WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROTOTYPE PHASE!!
